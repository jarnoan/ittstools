h1. Tools for using iTunes Connect more efficiently

Well, so far one tool only. 
In the traditional Open Source spirit there is very little documentation.

The stuff in this repository is in Public Domain. 
Use as you like, but at your own risk!

h2. weeklysales.sh

Shell script that fetches the latest weekly sales report from iTunes Connect,
saves it in a directory, appends it to a master report and mails it.
See the script for configurable parameters.
